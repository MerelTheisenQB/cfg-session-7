 I picked this dataset for you, but feel free to select another dataset.

Look at the dataset and the columns.
Examine the values in the columns.
remove missing values 
plot histogram of the values of different variables 
plot heatmaps and/or pair-plot 
etc.
You can simply follow the approach we presented in the last session. Feel free to reach out if you have any question.
